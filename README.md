As for the code, please download all the files in the *CODE* folder and run *main_xxx.m* with **MATLAB**. This code include four demonstrations:

1. Reconstruction of narrowband spectra: narrowband_spectra_reconstruction
2. Reconstruction of broadband spectra: broadband_spectra_reconstruction
3. Spectral imaging: spectral_imaging
4. Kernel generation of Savitzky-Golay (SG) filter: Savitzky-Golay_filter_generation
